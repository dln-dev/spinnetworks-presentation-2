LaTeX beamer presentation

This is a presentation I gave about spin networks for quantum state transfer in april 2016.
It includes a handout version in article form, so that I'll remember what I did here in the future.
The beamer template is MinimalGreen, which can be found in its respective repository here.

A simple makefile is included. Simply clone this repository and 'make all'. This should produce three pdf files with the slides, a handout version which is only used for including slides in the article and the article itself.
